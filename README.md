#### The Issue
In recent time, reading has fallen to the way side in a lot of younger people. Books have seen a large fall off in consumption, and I feel the need to try and fix this issue. I believe the main issue is many people haven't learned how to read at an advanced level. Most Americans haven't read a book since high school and remember their time with those books less than fondly. This is mostly due to the time commitment to reading that is required to finish a book. Most people don't feel the gratification of finishing a book due to the length of novels, so a manager that can show statistics of a person's reading time could be what they need to create a new hobby.

#### Project Summary
Bookeep was my ASE 420 project and focused on the logging and calculation of your books and word count. Now, I want to expand this webpage into a fully functioning book reading center for helping, managing, and developing reading skills. My hope for this project is to publish it and get people more into reading in an age where reading is down.
